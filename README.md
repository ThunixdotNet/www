# thunix 2.0 website update

This is the code powering the website for thunix, originally founded by hexhaxtron. Since the original site went down, amcclure and ubergeek revived the site, though with only the bare necessities.

These updates are designed to not only beautify the website with updated CSS and fully compliant HTML5 code, but also to automate visitor interaction with site administration. This includes PHP forms for emailing administrators with general inquiries, abuse reports and signing up for accounts.
