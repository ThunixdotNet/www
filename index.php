								<p>thunix tries to adhere to the values and philosophy of the Hacker Ethic whenever possible. The hacker ethics and beliefs as described by Levy are:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</li>
								<li>All information should be free</li>
								<li>Mistrust authority - promote decentralization</li>
								<li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position</li>
								<li>You can create art and beauty on a computer</li>
								<li>Computers can change your life for the better</li>
								</ul>
								<p>thunix will never use proprietary software but users can do that if they wish. This is something they should avoid however.</p>
