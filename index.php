<h3>About Thunix Shell Provider and Web Host</h3>
<p>Thunix offers Secure Shell (SSH) accounts, Web Hosting, Email Accounts,

and we hope you have fun with it!</p>

<p>Thunix tries to adhere to the values and philosophy of the Hacker Ethic whenever possible. The hacker ethics and beliefs as described by Levy are:
	<ul>
	<li>Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</li>
	<li>All information should be free</li>
	<li>Mistrust authority - promote decentralization</li>
	<li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position</li>
	<li>You can create art and beauty on a computer</li>
	<li>Computers can change your life for the better</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Thunix will never use proprietary software but users can do that if they wish. This is something they should avoid however.</p>
