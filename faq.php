							<p><b style="color: #FF00FF">How do I sign up for an account?</b><br>You can ask in #thunix on tilde.chat, or you can email amcclure (with the instructions on the main page).</p>
							<p><b style="color: #FF00FF">Who is running thunix?</b><br>The current system administrators are <a href="/~amcclure">amcclure</a> and <a href="/~ubergeek">ubergeek</a>.</p>
							<p><b style="color: #FF00FF">What happened to the old thunix?  Why the name change?</b><br>The original machine and founder dissappeared without any warning to anyone, including server staff. For this reason, most things were not backed up, and we needed to obtain a new domain name, and a new set of machines.</p>
