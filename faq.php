<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><b>How do I sign up for an account?</b><br>
You can ask in #thunix on tilde.chat, or you can email amcclure (with the instructions on the main page).
<p><b>Who is running Thunix?</b><br>
The current system administrators are <a href="/~amcclure">amcclure</a> and <a href="/~ubergeek">ubergeek</a>.
<p><b>What happened to the old thunix?  Why the name change?</b><br>
The original machine and founder dissappeared without any warning to anyone, including server staff.
For this reason, most things were not backed up. The founder hexhaxtron is currently not reachable,
so we needed to obtain a new domain name, and a new set of machines.
