# Changes to Terms of Service and Service Updates - April 2025

We've updated our Terms of Service to clarify rules around running serversâ€”now explicitly prohibited without prior approval. Please take a moment to review these important changes.

Additionally, due to low usage and maintenance overhead, we've decided to discontinue our BZFlag, Minetest, and Minecraft servers effective immediately. We appreciate everyone who participated and hope you enjoyed your time on these services.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!
