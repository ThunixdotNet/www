# State of the Thunix - Janurary 2020

Well happy new years to all you Thunixers!  Hope 2019 was a blast.

Thunix.net is officially over 1 years old this month!  We've had some
great times this year, and have some seen some awesome improvements:

* We started off on a tiny Digital Ocean Droplet, and moved to a
dedicated server
* We've implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Development
system for our website, man pages, gopher site, and system ansible
playbook.
* We offer:
   * Basic web services, like page hosting, email accounts, etc
   * VHosts if requested
   * DB's if requested
   * Rather liberal storage, RAM, and CPU usage guidelines
* Our services are encrypted via TLS whenever posssible (Email, chat,
website)
* We have a Tor Onion service for all services
* Multiple open source projects have had their births here
* We've iterated through **three** major software versions for our website
* We now have a community wiki

And tons more.  This is all largely thanks to you, the community that,
and our admins Naglfar and Fosslinux (aka Fossy).  Our
goal it to continue to tightly focus on building the community of users
here, and to make the system more privacy focused, and secure.  To make
it a better place for you, and a safer place.

At the close of the year, we will be re-doing some of our policies.  No
major deal breaking changes, but more or less making official some of the
things we do, and being even more open and transparent, which is our goal.

We've always tried to remain as transparent and open as possible, but we
also recognize that we can always do better at it.

Namely, our terms of service will get cleaned up, and some additions made.
The privacy policy will be getting reworked as well, to be far clearer in
what we do.  We will also be considering adoption a separate "Code of
Conduct" for community members.

That being said, last week, we implemented a third party email monitoring
service.  NO.  They do not get your emails, and scan them.  We would never
even consider that.  But, our deliverability reports are sent to a company
called "Postmark."  They aggregate our DMARC reports, and send us nice
reports.  They do not get any of your personal information, but we most
certainly want to be open about when we engage in third parties for our
data analysis.  When we can, it will be replaced with a open source tool,
but that requires us to write one, because at this time, none exist.

So, all that:  I'm looking forward to a great 2020!  We will keep growing,
and maybe the US will come out of it with a sane president, instead of the
current dumpster fire :)  Cheers, and excited to have you all aboard for
many more years to come!

Your sysop,
