# Season’s Greetings - December 2025

As the year winds down, a sincere thank-you to everyone who’s made Thunix feel like a real community and not just “a server with accounts.” Whether you’re here for SSH, web hosting, email, or the other UNIX-y odds and ends, we’re glad you’re part of this little corner of the internet.

If you’re taking some quiet time over the holidays, consider doing something wonderfully low-pressure: update your `~/public_html`, publish something on Gopher, poke at the Gemini capsule (`gemini://thunix.net`), or just hang out with us on IRC (`irc.newnet.net:6697` in `#thunix`). No algorithms, no shouting, just people making things.

However you spend the season: take care of yourself, be decent to each other, and we’ll keep doing our best to keep Thunix stable, secure, and fun.

# Changes to Terms of Service and Service Updates - April 2025

We've updated our Terms of Service to clarify rules around running servers—now explicitly prohibited without prior approval. Please take a moment to review these important changes.

Additionally, due to low usage and maintenance overhead, we've decided to discontinue our BZFlag, Minetest, and Minecraft servers effective immediately. We appreciate everyone who participated and hope you enjoyed your time on these services.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!

# Gemini is Live on Thunix! - Nov 2024

Hey everyone, exciting news—Thunix now supports Gemini! 🎉

You can check out our Gemini capsule at gemini://thunix.net. It's simple, fast, and perfect for sharing cool stuff without all the web bloat.

Got ideas for Gemini content? Let us know! And if you’re new to Gemini, dive in—it’s like the web, but chill. 😎

Catch you in the capsule! 🚀

# State of the Thunix - July 2023

We are on the mend.   deepend from tilde.club has taken on running Thunix and has started to build it up on his
own infrastructure.   Sign ups that come in will be kept in queue until the system is ready
for more users. 

More to come very soon.
