# State of the Thunix - July 09, 2019

Another Month!

We are at month 7 for Thunix.net!

Newly, over the past month, we have a wiki now!  It's an effort led by
contribute via tildegit, by opening a PR at:

https://tildegit.org/thunix/wiki

It's all in markdown, so it's pretty easy to contribute too.  And, if you
mess something up?  No worries!  It's a wiki!  We can revert :)

Also, new this month, we've made an official process and tool to provision
MySQL/MariaDB databases (It's MariaDB, btw).  All you need to do is
request one, and we'll gladly add it :)

No donations this month, and costs to operate the server still sit at
feel the need to do so, via https://thunix.net/donate.php

Iris is getting some usage too, so make sure you poke in there, via the
cli.

All in all, new features, new stuff, and looking forward to seeing other
contributions and new features come in from our users.
