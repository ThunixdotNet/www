# Donations

While this server and our projects are a labor of love and goodwill for the community, operating the thunix server still costs money. We love what we do and we love sharing what we do for free, but over time, operating expenses can have a big impact. In order to keep going, we rely on the good nature of generous people who are willing to donate to us. The price breakdown right now is €80/month. 

If you'd like to assist with server costs and help ensure we can spend time on the projects, you can donate in the following ways:
