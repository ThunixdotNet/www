<h2>Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>tl;dr - Be excellent to one another.</li>
	<li>Thunix is a free service, with no guarantees of uptime for the various service provided.</li>
	<li>One of the goals for Thunix is to be a collaborative environment.  Things that are detrimental to collaboration are not allowed.</li>
	<li>Harassment of other users is not allowed.  If a user tells you to break contact, that is what you MUST do.</li>
	<li>Be wary of rousing a sysadmin's wrath, for they are subtle, and quick to anger.  In other words, this is a fun place, and don't make it not so for the admin team.</li>
	<li>If you have questions, ask!  Nobody gets angry over a question asked, and if they do, tough.</li>
	<li>Don't hack the gibson.  While penetration testing can be fun, this is not the place for that.</li>
</ul>
