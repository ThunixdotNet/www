								<p>thunix relies on the common courtesy and consideration of users to make its services fair for everyone. The following offences will result in a service ban:</p>
								<ol>
								<li>Deliberately defacing the accounts of other users</li>
								<li>Deliberately trying to disrupt thunix's server</li>
								<li>Using thunix as a launch pad for disrupting other servers</li>
								<li>Using thunix to impersonate other websites and businesses for criminal purposes</li>

								<li>Storing/distributing content that defames any individual</li>
								<li>Promoting racial, ethnic, religious, political and other forms of bigotry</li>

								</ol>
								<p>Items 4, 5, 6 and 7 may also result in legal action against any offending users, depending on the severity of each case and any other individuals who may have been affected.</p>
								<p>Copyright infringement is not allowed on thunix, and we will not allow any illegal content to be distributed.</p>
								<p>It's also expected that all users respect the copyrights of those who produce original content of any kind (only share if the author or license grants you permission). However, using accounts for external file storage is permissible, under fair use and other laws promoting consumer rights. Note that original content from other users must also be respected, though creating/sharing public domain content is highly encouraged.</p>
								<p>If you want to request for content you own the copyright for to be removed from thunix, please email <a href="mailto:amcclure@ttm.sh"><code>&lt;amcclure@ttm.sh&gt;</code></a>. In the email, please identify who you are, if you are the copyright holder or legally representing them, the exact files you want removed with links to the files and infringed content, and contact information such as phone numbers or a reply-to email address.</p>
								<p>Users that repeatedly infringe copyrights will have their account removed. Depending on the degree of the offense, their account may be removed immediately.</p>

								<p>Privacy is a major concern for everyone. thunix respects the privacy rights of others and refuses to collect/store/distribute anyone's private information, except when necessary; thunix collects usernames and encrypted passwords for account registration purposes only, while logging IP addresses for server administration and policy enforcement purposes. The privacy rights of individual users may be overturned ONLY when it is known that they have violated the service terms; this is done strictly to uphold the service terms as well as the law.</p></div>
